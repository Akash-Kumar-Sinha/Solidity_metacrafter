# Project

A simple smart contract that provide functionalities like minting and burning and maintain the record

## Description

Token is a smart contract impelemented in Solidity, designed to demonstrate the creation of a token on Ethereum blockchain in a straightforward manner. Along with creating the token it also happens to manage the tokens. It showcases the essential features like minting and burning of token. In addition to this, the contracts also tracks the token balance to the address and the transaction a transparent and secure process.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone the repository:

```sh
>git clone https://github.com/Akash-Kumar-Sinha/Solidity_metacrafter.git
```
* Now change your current directory:
```sh
>cd Solidity_metacrafter
```

## Executing program
Open the contract file Token on your preferred Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix).
Compile the contract:
```sh
In Remix, click on the side section called "Solidity Compiler" and then compile it using "Compile Token"
```

Deploy the contract to your Ethereum network (<ins>can be a local network</ins>):
```sh
Now, click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" section, adjust your environment and contract accordingly, and then deploy the contract
```
Interact with the contract using the deployed instance. You can then pass the parameters(for address you can use your local address) and call the mint and burn functions.

## Help
In case any problem or error occurs, make sure you have correct Solidity version and along with the directory. Check on the parameters.

```sh
For additional help, you can even refer Remix documentation or Solidity documentation
```
